# fizzbuzz
This is an example of a fizzbuzz application. It is not meant to be extended, but is provided as an example of code written.
This is an examle of a common programming challenge set by development companies. Its called the "Fizzbuzz" test.
In short, it challenges the prospective developer to figure out the challenge of stepping through the numbers 1-100
and replace the values that are multiples of 3 with "fizz" and 5 with "buzz". It has the unique challenge where the value that are multiples of both
3 and 5 MUST be "fizzbuzz"
as it is a multiple of both 3 and 5. This code should be neat and scalable.
